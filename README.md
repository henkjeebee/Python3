These are exercises take from the book "Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3" by Charles Severance. For beginners, they are rewarding to figure out, especially when it comes to chapter 9 - the heart of the material for people seeking to learn Python.

Please only use these for educational purposes; see how the problem was approached (and the mistakes in that process), and analyze it for your own work. Please don't copy-paste, Dr Chuck would hate that, and you wouldn't want to disappoint Dr. Chuck now, would you?

These are definitely not the most elegant solutions, but they work, and are generalized whenever it was required, not always when possible. So there's definitely room for improvement. I also didn't start to truly document my code until chapter 10, but the code examples should ne short enough to grok them. Maybe I will update chapters 6 through 9 with comments in the future.

I excluded the puzzle assignments Dr. Chuck hands out on Coursera in the later courses as assignments. Although I do believe in sharing code to learn, I think that with comprehension of all the book exercises, one should be able to build the code as requested.
