These are exercises take from the book "Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3" by Charles Severance. For beginners, they are rewarding to figure out, especially when it comes to chapter 9 - the heart of the material for people seeking to learn Python.

Please only use these for educational purposes; see how the problem was approached (and the mistakes in that process), and analyze it for your own work. Please don't copy-paste, Dr Chuck would hate that, and you wouldn't want to disappoint Dr. Chuck now, would you?

These are definitely not the most elegant solutions, but they work, and are generalized whenever possible.
