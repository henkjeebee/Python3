These are exercises take from the book "Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3" by Charles Severance. They are rewarding and fun to figure out.

Please only use these for educational purposes; see how I went about solving the problem (and the mistakes I made), and analyze it for your own work. Please don't copy-paste, Dr Chuck would hate that, and you wouldn't want to disappoint Dr. Chuck now, would you?

These are definitely not the most elegant solutions, but they work, and are generalized whenever possible.
